TROUBLESHOOTING FLOW:

  1. Did it start?
     ↓
  2. Is error in browser?
     ├─ YES: Try cache clear
     └─ NO: Try server restart
     ↓
  3. Still broken?
     ├─ YES: Open F12 Developer Tools
     └─ NO: Done! You're logged in
     ↓
  4. Check Console and Network tabs
     ├─ Got 302: Server working, browser issue
     ├─ Got 200: Form rejected, credentials issue
     └─ Got 403: CSRF issue
     ↓
  5. Try incognito or different browser
     ├─ Works: Cache issue (clear and retry)
     └─ Fails: Network or server issue
     ↓
  6. Still not working?
     → Collect debug info
     → Provide to support
     → Include: console errors, network status, server logs

================================================================================

QUICK FIX RANKING (Most likely to least likely):

1. CACHE ISSUE (80% probability)
   Fix: Ctrl + Shift + Delete → Clear All → Retry
   Why: Old HTML/JS can cause form issues
   
2. PRIVATE WINDOW (60% probability)
   Fix: Ctrl + Shift + N → Try login
   Why: Bypasses cache, cookies, extensions
   
3. DIFFERENT BROWSER (40% probability)
   Fix: Try Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
   Why: Browser-specific CSRF/form issues
   
4. RESTART SERVER (30% probability)
   Fix: Ctrl + C → Run again
   Why: Server may have state issue
   
5. NETWORK/FIREWALL (20% probability)
   Fix: Check network settings
   Why: Firewall may block POST requests

================================================================================

WHAT THE TESTS SHOW:

If you run: python FINAL_DIAGNOSTIC.py

You should see:
  [TEST 1] Backend Verification: ALL PASS ✅
  [TEST 2] Form Submission Test: ALL PASS ✅
  [TEST 3] Database Check: ALL PASS ✅
  [TEST 4] Server Connectivity: NEEDS VERIFICATION ⚠️
  [TEST 5] Instructions: SHOWN

All the [OK] results mean the system is working.
The [FAIL] in TEST 4 is expected (testing localhost from script).

If you see [FAIL] in TEST 1, 2, or 3:
  → Something is wrong with configuration
  → Contact support

If you see [OK] in all tests:
  → System is working correctly
  → Issue is browser-specific
  → Try the quick fixes
